I am an Assistant Professor in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on AI for equitable, data-driven decision making in high-stakes social settings, integrating methods from machine learning, optimization, and social networks. Much of my work is motivated by public health applications, including HIV prevention, maternal and child health, and COVID-19. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Harvard University. Before joining CMU as an assistant professor, I was a postdoctoral Schmidt Science Fellow at Harvard School of Public Health and Carnegie Mellon University.
