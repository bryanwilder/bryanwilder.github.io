I am an Assistant Professor in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I study the foundations of machine learning for social, policy, and healthcare settings, blending new methodology with field evaluations to improve AIâ€™s societal impact. My work is shaped by collaborations with governments, nonprofits, health systems, and other partners. At CMU, I direct the Lab for AI and Social Impact. Our research has been funded by Schmidt Sciences, NSF, NIH, CDC, and the Engler Family Foundation. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Harvard University. Before joining CMU, I was a postdoctoral Schmidt Science Fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health. I serve as Chair of the Board of Directors for [EAAMO](https://eaamo.org/) and the associated [ACM EAAMO conference](https://conference.eaamo.org/).
