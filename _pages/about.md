I am a final-year PhD student at Harvard University, advised by [Milind Tambe](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/mtambe). I work on optimization and machine learning for social impact, with a focus on public health. My [recent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13732) [technical](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wang19e/wang19e.pdf) [work](files/aaai_melding.pdf) integrates algorithms for discrete optimization into deep learning models, enabling end-to-end training of systems that combine prediction and decision making. I've also worked on optimization and active learning for interventions that use social networks to disseminate information. My aim is to enable better decisions under uncertainty, particularly in the context of interventions that improve health for vulnerable populations. Applications include a recent project on [tuberculosis treatment in India](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01506), as well as a longer-running project on [HIV prevention for homeless youth](files/aamas_deployment.pdf). Our algorithmically-driven HIV intervention was recently field-tested by Los Angeles-area homeless centers, with preliminary results showing large improvement compared to status quo techniques. I am supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. During summer 2019, I interned at Microsoft Research Redmond, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Eric Horvitz](http://erichorvitz.com/) and [Ece Kamar](https://www.ecekamar.com/).
